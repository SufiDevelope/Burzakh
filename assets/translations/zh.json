In that moment, the reality that some may have been avoiding or denying throughout their lives becomes unmistakably clear.": "这节强有力的经文提醒我们：死亡揭示绝对真理。\"昏迷\"（sakrah）一词暗示死亡具有破除疏忽面纱的压倒性特质。那一刻，人们毕生逃避或否认的真相将无可辩驳地显现。",
  "The scholars explain that at this moment, the dying person sees their final destination - either Paradise or Hellfire. They may see angels of mercy or angels of punishment depending on their state. The Prophet Muhammad ﷺ taught that a believer's soul departs with ease, while for others, the departure may be more difficult.": "学者们解释：临终者将看见最终归宿——乐园或火狱。根据其状态，他们或见慈悯天使或见刑罚天使。先知穆罕默德ﷺ教导：信士的灵魂会轻松离体，而其他人则可能经历艰难。",

  "After washing, the body is wrapped in simple white shrouds (kafan) - three layers for men and five for women. The shrouding is done with simplicity, regardless of the person's status in life, as a reminder of our equality in death.": "洗浴后，遗体裹以素白寿衣（卡凡）——男性三层，女性五层。无论生前地位，一律从简包裹，以此提醒死亡面前人人平等。",

  "Sahih Muslim": "穆斯林圣训实录",

  "This powerful hadith emphasizes the importance of community gathering for the funeral prayer, as the collective prayers of forty sincere believers serve as an effective intercession for the deceased. It is for this reason that Muslims are encouraged to attend funeral prayers even for those they may not personally know.": "这段强力圣训强调集体参加殡礼的重要性，四十位虔诚信士的祈祷将成为对亡人有效的说情。因此穆斯林被鼓励参加殡礼，即使不认识亡人。",

  "The soul is then presented before Allah, where the record of deeds is acknowledged. For the righteous, there is joy and honor in this meeting, while for those who led sinful lives, this can be a moment of regret and sorrow.": "灵魂随后被带至安拉面前核验生平记录。清廉者将感受喜悦与尊荣，而作恶者将陷入悔恨与悲痛。",

  "After this presentation, the soul is returned to the body in the grave to experience the next phase of the journey - life in Barzakh. This return is described as a reunion of the soul with its physical form, albeit in a different manner than during worldly life.": "此后灵魂返回坟墓中的躯体，经历陵墓生活的下一阶段。这种回归被描述为灵魂与肉体的重聚，但其形式与现世生活不同。",

  "Questioning in the Grave": "坟墓中的审问",

  "After burial, the deceased is visited by two angels, Munkar and Nakir, who sit the person up and question them about their faith. The fundamental questions are: \"Who is your Lord? What is your religion? Who is your Prophet?\"": "下葬后，两位天使孟凯尔与奈克尔将使亡人坐起，审问其信仰。核心问题是：\"你的主宰是谁？你的宗教是什么？你的先知是谁？\"",

  "A believer will answer confidently: \"Allah is my Lord, Islam is my religion, and Muhammad is my Prophet.\" The Prophet ﷺ said that Allah will keep the believers firm with the right words in this critical moment.": "信士将坚定回答：\"安拉是我的主宰，伊斯兰是我的宗教，穆罕默德是我的先知。\"先知ﷺ说安拉将使信士在此关键时刻言辞坚定。",

  "This questioning is the first test of the afterlife and determines the immediate experience of the soul in Barzakh. For the believers who answer correctly, the grave will be expanded and filled with light. For others, the grave becomes a place of constriction and darkness.": "这是后世的第一道考验，决定灵魂在陵墓中的境遇。回答正确的信士，坟墓将宽敞明亮；其他人则将遭受狭窄与黑暗。",

  "The Prophet Muhammad ﷺ taught that believers should frequently remember death, as it serves as a reminder of our ultimate return to Allah. This remembrance helps us prepare for this questioning by strengthening our faith and living according to Islamic teachings.": "先知穆罕默德ﷺ教导信士应常记死亡，因其提醒我们终将归向安拉。这种记念通过强化信仰、遵循教义帮助我们为审问做准备。",

  "Barzakh is the intermediate state between death and resurrection, a realm where souls reside until the Day of Judgment. The Prophet Muhammad ﷺ taught that the grave will either be a garden from the gardens of Paradise or a pit from the pits of Hellfire.": "陵墓是死亡与复活之间的中介状态，灵魂在此停留直至审判日。先知穆罕默德ﷺ教导：坟墓或是乐园中的花园，或是火狱的深坑。",

  "For the righteous, their graves are expanded as far as the eye can see, filled with light and comfort. They are shown their place in Paradise each morning and evening. The souls of martyrs are in the form of green birds that fly freely in Paradise.": "清廉者的坟墓宽广明亮，早晚得见乐园居所。烈士的灵魂化作绿色飞鸟，自由翱翔于乐园。",
